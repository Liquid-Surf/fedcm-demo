      <h2>1. Log in to a Solid Server instance.</h2>
      <p> FedCM requires you to have a logged-in session from an IdP,
        in our case, a Solid server based on CSS.
        If your IdP is FedCM-compatible, you should only log in, and everything
        should be handled by the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, the only FedCM-compatible Solid server available is this demo <a id="accountlink">CSS instance</a>.
        (The compatibility is provided by <a href="https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/fedcm-demo"> this add-on</a>
        and by changing the cookie policy to <code>SameSite=None</code>, which also makes the server vulnerable,
        so it should be used for testing purposes only. It should be resolved in the future. See <a
          href="https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/587">#587</a>).
        <br />
        First, you need to create an account <a id="registerlink">here</a>,
        or just log in with the demo account:
      <ul>
        <li>username: <code>alice@example.org</code></li>
        <li>password: <code>alice</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you log in to CSS <strong>don't forget to click the "Register IdP" button before logging in</strong>
      </p>
      <a id="loginlink">You can log in here</a>
    </section>

      <h2>2. Log in to your Solid Server from the Solid Application</h2>
      <p> Now, if you try to fetch the resource below, you should receive an error:
        This is because you are trying to access a container (<code>/profile</code>) that is private by
        default.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let's log in using FedCM to fetch the resource.
      </p>
      <button id="startInruptLogin">Solid-OIDC Login With FedCM</button>
      </p>
      <p style="background-color: green; color: white;">
        <span id="loginstatus"></span>
      </p>
      <p>We are now logged in. As you can see, FedCM has automatically found the Solid server we were logged into.</p>
      <p>We also didn't have a redirection to our Solid server, nor a consent screen... pretty good UX!
        Try to fetch the resource again to confirm you're logged in.</p>
      <p>
        <!-- <details>
        <summary>( click me edirect url: </summary>
        <input id="redirect_url" />
      </details> -->
      </p>
    </section>

    <!--  Fetch Resource -->
    <section>
      <h2>3. Fetch a Protected Resource</h2>
      <p>
        <label for="resourceInput">Resource to view: (the default profile folder is a protected resource, see if you
          can view its contents) </label>
        <input type="text" id="resourceInput" placeholder="e.g. http://localhost:3000/alice/private/secret" />
        <button id="fetchResource">Fetch Resource</button>
